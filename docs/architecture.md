## 2. User roles and permissions matrix

| Role | Primary access | Key restrictions |
|---|---|---|
| Super Admin | Full system configuration, all modules, audit access | No direct user-data exposure outside authorized scopes |
| College Admin | Student/faculty records, examinations, fee, reports | Cannot alter protected health or payment gateway credentials |
| Faculty | Assigned subjects, attendance, marks, class records | Cannot edit fee or student private documents |
| Mentor | Assigned student academic progress and advisories | Limited to mentor cohort |
| Student | Own profile, academics, attendance, fees, library, placement, notices | Cannot view other students' records |
| Accounts Staff | Fees, payment registers, refund workflow | Cannot modify academic marks |
| Examination Staff | Exam setup, results, marks verification | No payment/hostel access |

### Permission examples
- `student:read:self`
- `student:write:own`
- `marks:read:assigned_students`
- `marks:write:course_scope`
- `fees:read:all`
- `fees:write:accounts_only`
- `document:verify:admin`
- `audit:read:admin`

## 3. Database ER diagram description

Entities form a normalized relational structure with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

Core hierarchy:
- User -> Role
- User -> Student | Faculty
- Student -> Guardian, Address, Document, HealthRecord, IdCard, Payment, Attendance, InternalMark, UniversityResult
- Course -> Branch -> Batch -> Section -> Semester -> Subject
- Subject is mapped through Enrollment/Academic records
- Notice, CalendarEvent, Holiday, Notification are cross-entity informational modules
- LibraryBook and LibraryTransaction track circulation
- Internship and Job business flows connect to Student and PlacementCompany
- Exam -> Question -> ExamAttempt
- AuditLog records actions made by users

## 4. Database schema

The detailed relational schema is implemented in Prisma in [prisma/schema.prisma](../prisma/schema.prisma).

Key tables:
- `User`
- `Role`
- `Permission`
- `Student`
- `Faculty`
- `Department`
- `Course`
- `Branch`
- `Batch`
- `Section`
- `Semester`
- `Subject`
- `Attendance`
- `InternalMark`
- `UniversityResult`
- `Fee`
- `Payment`
- `Guardian`
- `Address`
- `Document`
- `Notice`
- `CalendarEvent`
- `Holiday`
- `LibraryBook`
- `LibraryTransaction`
- `Internship`
- `PlacementCompany`
- `Job`
- `JobApplication`
- `Exam`
- `Question`
- `ExamAttempt`
- `Feedback`
- `HealthRecord`
- `IdCard`
- `BiometricRecord`
- `CanteenTransaction`
- `Notification`
- `AuditLog`

Design decisions:
- UUID or CUID primary keys
- soft delete pattern where needed
- timestamps for all mutable records
- unique constraints for identity and business keys
- indexed lookup keys on `studentId`, `userId`, `semesterId`, and `subjectId`

## 5. API architecture

### REST groupings
- `/api/auth` — login, refresh, logout, password reset, profile
- `/api/users` — user records and account activation
- `/api/students` — student profile management
- `/api/faculty` — faculty profiles and assignment management
- `/api/academics` — subjects, semesters, timetable, course data
- `/api/attendance` — attendance records and low-attendance alerts
- `/api/marks` — internal marks and analytics
- `/api/results` — university marksheets and SGPA/CGPA
- `/api/fees` — fee categories, dues, payment records
- `/api/documents` — secure upload, verify, preview, approval
- `/api/library` — issue, return, due fines
- `/api/internships` — internship tracking
- `/api/placements` — company listings and applications
- `/api/exams` — online exam management and attempts
- `/api/notifications` — centralized notifications
- `/api/reports` — PDF/Excel/CSV exports
- `/api/admin` — dashboards and system reports

### Security layer
- JWT access token + refresh token model
- role validation middleware
- per-route authorization checks
- input validation with Zod
- rate limiting and request quotas
- secure file storage references only, not raw file paths
- centralized error formatter

## 8. Design system

### Design tokens
